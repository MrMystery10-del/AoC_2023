## Puzzle opinion
### Puzzle 1
The first part was pretty easy eventho i never used Kotlin before, the implementation of my ideas in Kotlin were very fast.
The Part 2 was a pain in the ass, because they not mentioned that twone is merged should also be detected as 21 and not just 2 which
messed up the redex i used before

### Puzzle 2
Way easier than Day 1, needed to read the first part like 3 times to understand what the puzzle is expecting from me
but found the correct solution first try.
For Part 2 i literally had to change 1 single line and had a working solution because of my object approach which is
prob pretty bad because i have no clue how to work with Kotlin efficient but i have a solution and i dont care if its fast or not

### Puzzle 3
The part 1 did take bit time because i didnt thought about when the number is on the end of line, my solution were adding the part-number
to the list only when the next symbol is not a digit which well... messed the result up.
Overall after fixing it this day was not hard and part 2 i did also completed in like 2 minutes, only some lines need to be changed

### Puzzle 4
Sadly finished this solution one day after the puzzle day.
My brain wasnt braining, because i had an exam in parallel which messed me up. I hate my solution and hate that its 5pm and i still not 
started with day 5 puzzle in which i also did set me the challenge to finish day 5-8 in Go and i havnt even learned Go yet so everything SUCKS.
But trust me, im gonna catch up sooner or later :P

### Puzzle 5
Sadly currently only solved part 1. Part 2 is already implemented but gives the wrong result currently.
Overall this task isnt really hard but i still wonder why part 2 does not giv correct result on main input but does give
correct result on example input.
