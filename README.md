## Puzzle opinion
### Puzzle 1
The first part was pretty easy eventho i never used Kotlin before, the implementation of my ideas in Kotlin were very fast.
The Part 2 was a pain in the ass, because they not mentioned that twone is merged should also be detected as 21 and not just 2 which
messed up the redex i used before

### Puzzle 2
Way easier than Day 1, needed to read the first part like 3 times to understand what the puzzle is expecting from me
but found the correct solution first try.
For Part 2 i literally had to change 1 single line and had a working solution because of my object approach which is
prob pretty bad because i have no clue how to work with Kotlin efficient but i have a solution and i dont care if its fast or not
