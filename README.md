## Puzzle opinion
### Puzzle 1
The first part was pretty easy eventho i never used Kotlin before, the implementation of my ideas in Kotlin were very fast.
The Part 2 was a pain in the ass, because they not mentioned that twone is merged should also be detected as 21 and not just 2 which
messed up the redex i used before

### Puzzle 2
Way easier than Day 1, needed to read the first part like 3 times to understand what the puzzle is expecting from me
but found the correct solution first try.
For Part 2 i literally had to change 1 single line and had a working solution because of my object approach which is
prob pretty bad because i have no clue how to work with Kotlin efficient but i have a solution and i dont care if its fast or not

### Puzzle 3
The part 1 did take bit time because i didnt thought about when the number is on the end of line, my solution were adding the part-number
to the list only when the next symbol is not a digit which well... messed the result up.
Overall after fixing it this day was not hard and part 2 i did also completed in like 2 minutes, only some lines need to be changed

### Puzzle 4
Sadly finished this solution one day after the puzzle day.
My brain wasnt braining, because i had an exam in parallel which messed me up. I hate my solution and hate that its 5pm and i still not 
started with day 5 puzzle in which i also did set me the challenge to finish day 5-8 in Go and i havnt even learned Go yet so everything SUCKS.
But trust me, im gonna catch up sooner or later :P

### Puzzle 5
This puzzle did take me a lot of time... This puzzle overall wasnt hard and i did solved part 1, but when it came to part 2, oh boyy...
It was easy and i had a working solution first try but i just didnt knew it was the correct solution, it did work for the example input
but not for the main input. The issue was that it somehow had the correct result + 1 which was of course wrong when i did submit. So the
solution was just to add -1 and everything is working now. I still dont know why but it is how it is and did cost me around 5 hours starring
on my screen and not understanding what is wrong with this brute-force approach

### Puzzle 6
It was so freaking easy, it did take me literally around 10 minutes for both parts i wonder why that wasnt day 1
