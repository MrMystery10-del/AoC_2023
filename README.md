## Puzzle opinion
### Puzzle 1
The first part was pretty easy eventho i never used Kotlin before, the implementation of my ideas in Kotlin were very fast.
The Part 2 was a pain in the ass, because they not mentioned that twone is merged should also be detected as 21 and not just 2 which
messed up the redex i used before
